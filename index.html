  <h1> Coding With Atom.io and Github </h1>

<p> Today I will be talking about Atom.io and Github, two very useful apps used for coding. Atom.io is also associated with Github, in fact, if your on the Atom.io app page making a website, to the bottom-left it litterly says Github and next to it Git.</p>
<p> Atom.io also has a cool, but helpful, feature. If you type in 'html' and press the tab button, it will fill in all the basic coding like language and body.</p>
<p> But just because the Github package comes with two awesome and helpful apps, (Git and Atom.io) doesn't mean that coding will be easy, or uploading it. So, you have to know how to code.</p>
<p> <a href="https://allinonehighschool.com/atom-2/">Here's a helpful learing course, it is totally free. I use it myself</a> It helps most of the time, but sometimes the coding messes up. So, you have to problem-solve.</p>
<p> Mistakes are totally OKAY. You know, it took me 13 times until I finally made <a href="https://jesusislord12.github.io/CardGames/">my first website.</a> That was just using Github and Notepad.
<p> Like I said before Atom.io is associated with Github, but it can work with...</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript.</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Python</li>
</ul>
<p> That's seven diffrents types of coding to chose from!</p>
<p> Long story short I think that Atom.io and Github are the best apps to use for coding.
